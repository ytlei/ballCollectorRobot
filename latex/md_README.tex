Ball Collector Robot project

\subsection*{Overview}

build a simulation of the ball collector robot on R\+OS. It will be built with turtlebot robot in R\+OS. The ball collector robot can find the nearest ball and goes to the ball and push them back to the corner for users to collect easily.

The Robot\+: Use turtlebot as a foundation and use the sensor on it to see the environment and objects. After Acquiring the object, generate a path using navigation technique to collecting the ball. The environment\+: create a simulated tennis court with balls placed randomly and with walls on four sides. Tools may include Gazebo Simulator, Turtlebot module, and R\+OS.

\subsection*{Dependencies}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item R\+OS Kinetic
\item navigation modules
\item gazebo turtlebot packages
\item geometry modules
\item google test for unit tests
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Building}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # into catkin workspace src/ folder
2 git clone https://github.com/ytlei/ballCollectorRobot.git
3 
4 # from catkin workspace root
5 catkin\_make 
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Issues}

Due to some delay with simulation problems, the explore navigation function was not built yet. It can only run with predefined ball locations.

\subsection*{Demo}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # this will launch gazebo, and the core nodes
2 roslaunch ball\_collector\_robot launch\_world\_test.launch.xml include\_gazebo:=1
3 
4 # in a separate terminal
5 demo/demo.sh 
\end{DoxyCode}

\subsection*{Doxygen Documentation}

To generate the doxygen documentation from the root directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 doxygen doxygen.config
\end{DoxyCode}


This will create the documentation in the docs directory.
